1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed
I would fit the automated testing in github actions that runs whenever code is pushed because thi will ensure the code is working every time a major change is being made/pushed to the source code.

3. No, I would not test, because sending a message would be using multiple componenets of the messaging app. This would be considered E2E testing.
